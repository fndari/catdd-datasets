# A simple system for data aggregation and curation

This system is based on [Data Packages](https://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages), a simple but flexible protocol for storing dataset.

It was created and supported by Frictionless Data, an open-data collaboration/initiative developing and maintaning open source tools for data curation and distribution.

Data packages ars based on the simple combination of tabular text files (CSV/TSV) to store data, and a JSON file (`datapackage.json`) storing metadata of the datasets and the tables' fields.

The simplicity of the concept makes it very flexible and easy to integrate with existing data distribution portals and technologies.

A tutorial illustrating the process of producing and distributing a Data Package can be found [here](https://frictionlessdata.io/field-guide/data-publication-workflow-example/).
Any editor able to open text files can be used to work on data packages.
A web-based interface, the [Data-Package Creator](https://create.frictionlessdata.io/), can be used to quickly and intuitively create, modify, or export data packages.
